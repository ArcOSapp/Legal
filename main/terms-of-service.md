# Terms of Service

_Last updated: June 29, 2025_  
_These Terms govern your use of Arc, the tech career platform available at ArcOS.app._

Welcome to Arc. By accessing or using any part of our product — including portfolio generation, résumé tools, profile hosting, and job application tools — you agree to the terms below. If you do not agree with them, do not use the platform.

These terms apply to all users of the service — including job seekers, freelancers, contractors, recruiters, and anyone else interacting with Arc.

---

## 1. Your Arc Account

You may use Arc by creating an account via email or authenticating with supported providers like Google or GitHub.

You are responsible for:
- Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials  
- The activity that occurs under your account  
- Ensuring the data you submit is accurate, honest, and lawful

If we suspect misuse, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without notice.

---

## 2. Use of the Platform

Arc grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the platform solely for its intended purpose: managing your tech career.

You agree:
- Not to impersonate another person or misrepresent your credentials  
- Not to upload or share illegal, harmful, hateful, or misleading content  
- Not to interfere with or disrupt the platform’s functionality or security  
- Not to scrape, resell, clone, or replicate Arc’s intellectual property without permission

Violation of these terms may result in permanent account suspension and legal action.

## 3. User Content & Ownership

You own the content you create and upload to Arc — including portfolio entries, project summaries, and résumé content. However, by uploading content, you grant Arc a license to:

- Display, process, and format it within your Arc profile  
- Generate derivative outputs (e.g. AI-tailored résumés or summaries)  
- Improve the user experience via anonymized examples (never publicly or commercially without your permission)

We do not claim ownership of your work. You may delete your content or account at any time.

---

## 4. AI-Generated Content

Arc uses machine learning tools to assist with résumé writing, profile summaries, and skill suggestions. You understand and agree that:

- AI outputs may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information  
- You are responsible for reviewing and approving any content submitted using AI tools  
- Arc does not assume liability for consequences resulting from AI-generated suggestions

We recommend reviewing outputs before sending them to employers or clients.

## 5. Platform Availability

We do our best to maintain 24/7 uptime, but Arc is provided **“as is”** with no guarantee of uninterrupted availability. We reserve the right to:

- Add, remove, or modify features at any time  
- Perform maintenance with or without notice  
- Shut down inactive or abusive accounts  
- Limit access if required by legal or technical constraints

We are not liable for downtime, data loss, or business losses caused by use of the platform.

---

## 6. Payments & Subscriptions (if applicable)

Some features of Arc may be offered as paid services (e.g. Arc Boost). By subscribing, you agree to:

- Pay recurring fees via your chosen payment method  
- Cancel anytime via your account settings  
- No refunds will be issued for partial billing periods, unless required by law

We may change our pricing at any time, with notice via email or in-app messaging.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Arc and its team are **not liable** for:

- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages  
- Job losses, failed applications, missed opportunities, or hiring decisions  
- Any claims arising from user-generated content  
- Any issues caused by third-party integrations (e.g. GitHub, Figma, Supabase)

Use Arc at your own risk. We do our best to keep things stable and safe, but no system is perfect.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. You’ll be notified of any material changes via email or in-app alert. Continued use of Arc means you accept the new terms.

**TL;DR:**  
Use Arc responsibly. Don’t abuse it. You own your data. We don’t sell it. AI helps, but you’re still the boss of your own résumé.
